# 🎮 **AM Engine**

AM Engine is a small **work in progress** 2D game engine written in **C#**.  
It is an ongoing project, built with the goal of developing a minimal **ECS-driven engine** released as a **NuGet package**.

The purpose is to **learn, experiment, and lay down a clean and extendable foundation** that will later be used (by myself) to create an actual game powered by this engine.

For now, it's a **work in progress — growing step by step.** 🚧
